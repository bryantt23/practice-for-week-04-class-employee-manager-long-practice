  /*
Inside of `_totalSubSalary()`, create a sum variable. Check to see if each
`employee` is an instance of `Manager`. If so, add their `salary` plus a
recursive call to their `_totalSubSalary()` to sum. If not, simply add
their `salary` to sum. 

The `calculateBonus` logic should look something like this:

```plaintext
bonus = (manager's salary + total salary of all employees under them)
 * multiplier
```
